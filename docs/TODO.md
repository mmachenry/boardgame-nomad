* Implement a pass-and-play secret feature. If I view my info by clicking on
a button, that button should be greyed out so as to only be viewable once
without resetting the whole game to ensure everyone looks at exactly one piece
of information.

* Translate words to other languages

* Allow wavelengths value to be hidden and improve visual

* put baseurl into the env and use  import.meta.env.BASE_URL put them
 in env.production and env.dev

For codes names, there could be a random, easy to type checksum that is
stateless. A gamecode. When you generate a game, the code for it appears at
the bottom of the screen. Loading this app with the game code lets you open
this exact game on another screen and view the decode sheet. Or possibly it's
not even necessary. You could generate a decode sheet on a separate device
without even linking the two. But... it's helpful if you decide to change
devices.
